### Hello!

I am a software engineer specializing in web technology with an emphasis on Golang and JavaScript development.

Currently I work at [Persefoni](https://persefoni.com/) as a Senior Data Engineer primarily using Golang and MySQL.

Formerly I worked at [@iStreamplanet](https://github.com/iStreamPlanet) (as [@ammiranda-isp](https://github.com/ammiranda-isp)), [@zillow](https://github.com/zillow) and [@NOAA-ORR-ERD](https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD) (as [@alexmiranda-NOAA](https://github.com/alexmiranda-NOAA)).
